# Sink_A_DotCom
Java program that is a game similar to battleship. It contains 3 DotComs that are ramdomly distributed always in three consecutive cells 
(horizontally or vertically) and the user's goal is to find them. I created the classes:
    -> DotComBust, that holds methods related to the game, as the ones to finishGame() and to startPlaying();
    -> DotCom; that holds methods and instance variables related to the DotComs;
    -> GameHelper, that implements a method to get user's input and a method to ramdonly distribute the DotComs;
 As soon as you finish, you will get a score based on the number of guesses you took.
